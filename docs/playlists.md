title: Playlist Management

## Overview

This bot also provides very basic playlist functionality[^1]. Playlists here are simply stored as plaintext and are given a name.

[^1]: Playlists are implemented this way for legacy reasons

The first two playlist commands are the [`;check`](#check) command and the [`;playlist`](#playlist) command

| Command with Arguments[^1] | Aliases | Cooldown | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| [`;check`](#check) `<name>` | `;h1` | 1s | Output the text for a single playlist |
| [`;playlist`](#playlist) | `;li` | 1s | Configure playlists |



And some owner-only subcommands
