No role restrictions set for featuers, other than owner, that is up to the user that forks this bot

this bot (JoshGone music) is a basic bare bones, there are minimal permissions stuff implemented so feel free to add that (anyone), like DJ roles and such

How is this bot different than the others?

Design philosopy (keyboard ASCII, simple, etc.)
