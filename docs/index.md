No role restrictions set for featuers, other than owner, that is up to the user that forks this bot

this bot (JoshGone music) is a basic bare bones, there are minimal permissions stuff implemented so feel free to add that (anyone), like DJ roles and such

How is this bot different than the others?

## TODO

- [ ] `<>` not actually needed for optional arguments
- [ ] Update JGM envvars and db name
- [ ] Turn all emphasis '', "" to italics
- [ ] 1x vs x1 speed
- [ ] Design philosopy (keyboard ASCII, simple, etc.)
