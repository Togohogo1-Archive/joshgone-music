No role restrictions set for featuers, other than owner, that is up to the user that forks this bot

this bot (JoshGone music) is a basic bare bones, there are minimal permissions stuff implemented so feel free to add that (anyone), like DJ roles and such

How is this bot different than the others?

## TODO

- [ ] Fix inconsistency with GLOBAL_EFFECTS
- [ ] Click links on the docs should link externally
- [ ] Tags for command versioning
