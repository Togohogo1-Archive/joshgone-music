### [`batch_add`](#batch_add)

Plays from multiple URLs split by lines.

Splits the URLs by appropriate line termination character and individually [`stream`](#stream)s [ref] each query. Does not support specification of local queries. Assuming no lag, there is approximately a 0.1 second delay between additions.

**Arguments**

- `urls` â€“ (Required) The multiline string of URLs to be [`stream`](#stream)ed, separated by ++enter++ keypresses

**Before Invoking Behaviour**

- Bot must be connected to a voice channel

??? example

    Running

    ```
    ;batch_add
    Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen
    Billie Jean - Michael Jackson
    Hotel California - Eagles
    Sweet Child o' Mine - Guns N' Roses
    Rolling in the Deep - Adele
    ```

    will stream [ref] those songs in that order. Note that for longer lists, Discord will only allow the rapid sending of 5 messages at a time.
